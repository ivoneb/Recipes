Arancini

Ingredients:
- 1L Chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 brown onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed

Methods:
1. 	Place the stock in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring just to the boil. 
	Cover and reduce heat to low. Hold at a gentle simmer.

2. 	Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and 
	garlic and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until the 
	onion is soft.

3.	Add the rice to the onion mixture and cook, stirring, until the grains appear 
	slightly glassy. Add a ladleful (about 125ml/1/2 cup) of the simmering stock to
	the rice mixture and stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the liquid is 
	completely absorbed. Continue to add the stock, 1 ladleful at a time, stirring 
	constantly and allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next 
	ladleful, for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender yet firm to the bite and 
	the risotto is creamy. Stir in the parmesan. Set aside for 2-3 hours to cool 
	completely. Add 2 eggs and stir until well combined.
